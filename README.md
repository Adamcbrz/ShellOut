# üêö ShellOut

Welcome to ShellOut, a simple package that enables you to easily ‚Äúshell out‚Äù from a Swift script or command line tool.

Even though you can accomplish most of the tasks you need to do in native Swift code, sometimes you need to invoke the power of the command line from a script or tool - and this is exactly what ShellOut makes so simple.

## Usage

 Just call `shellOut()`, and specify what command you want to run, along with any arguments you want to pass:

```swift
let output = try shellOut(to: "echo", arguments: ["Hello world"])
print(output) // Hello world
```

In case of an error, ShellOut will automatically read `STDERR` and format it nicely into a typed Swift error:
```swift
do {
    try shellOut(to: "totally-invalid")
} catch {
    let error = error as! ShellOutError
    print(error.message) // Prints STDERR
    print(error.output) // Prints STDOUT
}
```

## Installation
